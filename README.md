## General Information

The objective of this assignment is to try and predict the stock prices using historical data from four companies IBM (IBM), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT).
We use four different companies because they belong to the same sector: Technology. Using data from all four companies may improve the performance of the model. This way, we can capture the broader market sentiment.

## Conclusions
**Model Training approach and Results**
The data analysis was conducted with a training and valdation split of 80:20
